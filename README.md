# Water-Brand-Responsive-Website_HTML-CSS-JS_in-progress
This is a responsive website for a water brand called Your Water written in HTML, CSS and JS. I created this project to practice CSS Grid and Flexbox, and to practice creating websites based on ready designs. This project is created based on my own full web design, ux and ui, including the prototype with some transitions and other effects. You can see the design project on my Behance page https://www.behance.net/svetlanacheban
